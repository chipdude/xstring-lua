I have not (yet) decided on a license for this project.  Therefore you don't
(yet) have the right to share copies.  However, you can tell your friends to
fetch it from where I have made it available, which as of this writing is:
  http://topaz.cx/xstring-1.0.tar.gz.
(I don't need a license to make it available, you see, since I wrote it. :-))
